Stable Diffusion Inpainting with Depth Maps for Video Generation
Overview
This project focuses on image inpainting using the Stable Diffusion model, incorporating depth maps for realistic rendering. The main objective is to take an initial image and modify it based on text prompts while maintaining specific objects in the image unchanged. The project further extends to generate video frames, producing a natural, zoomed-out, or translated video output based on the prompts.

Project Structure
Load the Stable Diffusion Inpainting Pipeline
Download and Process Input Image
Create Object Mask for the Image
Generate Depth Map Using Pretrained Model
Apply Image Inpainting Using Depth Map
Generate Video Frames Based on Text Prompts
Save and Export Frames into a Video File
Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Load the Stable Diffusion Inpainting Pipeline
The Stable Diffusion Inpainting model is loaded from stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting. The model is configured to run on the GPU (using CUDA) for faster computation.

python
Copy code
pipe = StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting",
    torch_dtype=torch.float32,
)
pipe.to("cuda")
2. Download and Process Input Image
This section defines a function to download the initial image from a URL and convert it into an RGB format using PIL.

python
Copy code
def download_image(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert("RGB")
Replace the image URL with your desired image, or insert your custom image by uploading it locally. You could add a picture of the downloaded image here for better clarity.

3. Create Object Mask for the Image
The object mask is created to ensure that the part of the image you want to keep unchanged is preserved. The mask identifies the object of interest by isolating it from a white background.

python
Copy code
def create_object_mask(image):
    # Mask creation code here...
    return Image.fromarray(inverted_mask).resize(image.size)
This step could include a visual demonstrating the image before and after applying the mask.

4. Generate Depth Map Using Pretrained Model
A depth map is generated using a pretrained depth estimation model (Intel/dpt-large). This helps create a more realistic background based on the perspective and spatial features of the image.

python
Copy code
def generate_depth_map(image):
    # Code to generate depth map
    return depth_map_image
You can upload the depth map image here to give viewers a sense of how depth estimation influences the inpainting.

5. Apply Image Inpainting Using Depth Map
Here, image inpainting is applied using a prompt that defines the modifications to the scene, along with the generated object mask and depth map. Various hyperparameters like num_inference_steps and guidance_scale control the generation process for creative freedom.

python
Copy code
new_image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    image=init_image,
    mask_image=mask_image,
    depth_map=depth_map_image,
    num_inference_steps=num_inference_steps,
).images[0]
Include a side-by-side comparison of the original image and the inpainted image.

6. Generate Video Frames Based on Text Prompts
Video frames are generated for each prompt, creating a sequence of frames where the object remains unaltered while the scene evolves according to each prompt. The prompts are designed to create diverse scenes, and the depth map ensures realistic lighting and perspective adjustments.

python
Copy code
def frame_creation(init_image, prompts, negative_prompt, scale_factor=0.77):
    # Code to generate frames...
    return frames
Here, you can upload a gallery of generated frames, showing how the image changes with each prompt.

7. Save and Export Frames into a Video File
The frames are saved as a video file using OpenCV. You can adjust the frame rate (fps) and target size to achieve the desired output quality.

python
Copy code
def save_frames_to_video(frames, output_path, fps=1, target_size=(512, 512)):
    # Code to save frames into video
Upload the video as part of the final output, or include a download link.

How to Run the Project
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate torch PIL numpy requests opencv-python matplotlib
Run the Code You can run the provided code either in a local environment or using a cloud platform like Google Colab or Kaggle. Make sure to have GPU access enabled.

Output

The final output is a video showcasing the transitions between various prompts, with the object (e.g., a chair, electric cooker) remaining unchanged.
Customizing the Project
Change the Input Image
Replace the URL or path to the input image to work with different objects.
Modify Prompts
The prompts used for image generation can be customized to describe different scenes and objects.
Tweak Hyperparameters
Experiment with num_inference_steps, guidance_scale, and other parameters to see how they affect the quality and speed of image generation.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the powerful combination of Stable Diffusion, depth maps, and image inpainting for creating realistic, contextually rich images and videos. It showcases how AI models can be used to manipulate and enhance visuals while keeping specific elements intact.

Feel free to customize the code and experiment with different objects and environments to create your unique outputs!
